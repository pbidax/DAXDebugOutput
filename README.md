# DAXDebugOutput

This is a free UI tool that subscribes to Analysis Services Trace Events, parses the JSON output of DAX Evaluation Log events, and displays the information in user friendly table format.

This tool is my own effort to help the Power BI community. It is not a Microsoft company product.

This is a 64-bit Windows desktop .NET Core application. You install the tool using the published MSI on the same machine as the Power BI Desktop application. It works with Power BI Desktop August 2022 release or later.
